# ROCKET-THRUST-CALCULATOR
This Python program calculates and visualizes the thrust produced by a rocket over time using the formula Thrust = Mass Flow Rate Ã— Exhaust Velocity. It takes user input for multiple time intervals and plots a graph showing how thrust varies during the launch.
ðŸš€ Rocket Thrust Plotter
This Python program calculates the thrust produced by a rocket over time based on user input and visualizes it using a graph. It uses the formula:

Thrust (F) = Mass Flow Rate (m) Ã— Exhaust Velocity (ve)

The program is interactive â€” it takes input for multiple time intervals and plots a Thrust vs Time graph.

ðŸ§® Features
Takes user input for:

Mass flow rate (kg/s)

Exhaust velocity (m/s)

Calculates thrust at each time step.

Plots a graph showing how thrust varies over time.

Helps in understanding the thrust profile of a single rocket during its launch.
